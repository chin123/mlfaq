The International Institute of Information Technology, a Deemed University, popularly known as IIIT-B, was established in 1999 with a vision to contribute to the IT world by focusing on education and research, entrepreneurship and innovation. The Institute is a registered not-for-profit society funded jointly by the Government of Karnataka and the IT industry.

Since its inception, IIIT-B, with its unique model of education, research, and industry interaction, has grown in stature to become an institution of considerable repute in academic as well as corporate circles. The Institute works in partnership with the corporate sector, while retaining the freedom of an academic institution. It is inspired by other renowned institutions, and also strives to emulate an academic culture that is on par with the best international institutions.

To build on the track record set by India in general and Bangalore in particular, to enable India to play a key role in the global IT scenario through a world class institute with a focus on education and research, entrepreneurship and innovation.

The graduate programs at IIIT-B are among the best in the country, offering training oriented towards producing highly qualified practitioners and researchers. As an independent institution and a deemed university, IIIT-B collaborates with the IT industry, leading academic institutions abroad, and eminent scientists and industry leaders to offer students the best possible education. Our students have been well received by industry, and have been placed with some of the leading companies in the field; in fact, IIIT-B can boast of 100% placement for all its graduates.

Students are encouraged to ask questions, pursue their research interests, and gain membership and respect in the select club of high-achieving IT professionals. The infrastructure and interactions that IIIT-B offers students and faculty makes possible the pursuit of individual and joint projects, industry-sponsored research, and study that is of the highest standards required for global competitiveness.

The Institute has a relaxed, friendly atmosphere, but with a constant buzz of excitement due to many well-known visitors including giants from industry, well-known scientists, and leaders of government from all over the world.

Admission is selective but not restrictive. We are very proud of the achievements of our alumni, and strive to gain good students who will achieve their potential and continue this trend. We thus warmly welcome applicants from different backgrounds who share our vision of excellence.

At IIITB, we follow the notion of research labs and centers which is an abstraction of a particular theme/area. A research lab encompasses people, projects, physical facilities, and activities. A research center or a center of excellence is an abstraction either in terms of the broader set of research themes being followed or in terms of hierarchy of research activities.

If Computer Science is about the use of computational techniques and thinking for solving problems, it stands to reason that computer science in turn can and must be applied to address the many critical problems of the 21st century, of which we may mention the need for smart machines and complex systems that can work with humans seamlessly and improve society as a whole, and sustainable development and usage of systems to make effective use of scarce and expensive resources such as energy. The tools and paradigms used to address such problems can themselves be new ones, other than merely the ones traditionally found in the repertoire of computer scientists. To this end, our work in the computer science research domain covers diverse topics dealing with theory as well as application areas, such as smart grids, supply chains and their optimization, algorithms, machine learning, cloud computing, dynamic modeling and control of servers, and renewable energy. With the tremendous rise in distributed computing applications, the issue of security and privacy in distributed applications has got tremendous attention from the research community in the past decade. A major theme of the cryptographic research at IIITB is secure distributed computing, with emphasis on secure multi-party computation (MPC) and verifiable computation, both at the theoretical as well as applied level. While we strive to be rigorous and thorough in all our research, whether theoretical or applied, we are also aware of the multidisciplinary context and significance of our work, and strive to address issues that are relevant to society in general and industry in particular. The focus of work in Computational Topology at IIITB is towards using topological methods for improving visual representation and information extraction from scientific datasets.

Today we don't need separate devices for talking on the phone, listening to music, watching videos, surfing the Internet, reading/sending e-mails. Information convergence is a similar concept that is focused on interoperability of information scattered across multiple dimensions and multiple sources and destinations. The focus of the Information Convergence Lab (I-COG Lab) is to first identify and define various information convergence challenges that are relevant to the real world. The current focus of the lab is to start with a study of information convergence challenges specifically targeted at large enterprises and the government. Based on this understanding of the needs and contexts of information convergence, the lab will specify reusable frameworks that address these challenges in a unified and integrated environment. The focus would be to develop standards-based solutions that can be applied widely.

The Information Technology and Society research domain at IIITB is broadly concerned with the social role of information and communications technologies (ICTs) with a focus on the policy challenges and the institutional demands posed by technological change. Teaching and research in the stream focuses on three inter-related areas. First, it seeks to understand innovation and the organization of production in the ICT industry, or how, why and where ICTs are produced. A second area of interest is in how ICTs can be used to harness the legitimacy and the powers of bureaucracies and markets to address needs in different social domains. Of special interest are the domains of governance, education, health and manufacturing. A third area is the tools and analytical techniques that can be deployed to understand the production and consumption of ICTs. These include geographical information systems, modeling, simulation and visualization. The domain encourages inter-disciplinary research and has associated faculty members with expertise in social sciences, including in economics, economic geography, sociology, development, management, governance and public administration.

    Center for Information Technology and Public Policy

    The Center for Information Technology and Public Policy (CITAPP) at IIITB focuses on the policy challenges and the organizational demands made by technological innovation. The Center is interested in interactions between technology and society and is particularly concerned with how technological advances, along with institutional changes, address the needs of under-served communities. It seeks to provide a means to nurture and transform public policy through the use of IT by engaging with academic faculty and researchers, policy planners, political leaders and community representatives, technology vendors, public officials and civil society organizations. The Center brings together best-practices demonstrating the power of IT and analytical tools for information management, modelling, and forecasting. It engages in research and evaluation studies of topics where IT and public interest intersect.

The research at IIITB in Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics are given here.

In CHEMISTRY, the research at IIITB primarily is in the area of electronic structure calculations. Particularly, weak interactions (pi-pi, CH-pi etc.) present in various systems (small model systems, protein-ligand systems, DNA bases, nanotubes etc.) are investigated using quantum chemical methods (HF, MP2, CCSD(T) & DFT). Additionally, the work entails unravelling the role of such weak interactions in the field of drug-design, polymers, nano-devices and in new materials. Some of the recent research works show that pi-pi and CH-pi interactions are invariably present in the crystal structures of bio-molecules and play important role in their structure as well as functions.
